# Project7-Classifying-and-predicting-the-sentiment-of-reviews
In this project we tried to compare a combination of machine learning models and deep learning models to see which of these models did the best at classifying and predicting the sentiment of reviews by comments alone. Additionally there's also a soon to be published paper about this project called "Classifying and Predicting The Rating Sentiment of Women's E-commerce Clothing Reviews: A Comparative Study Using SVM, ANN, and BERT Models". The dataset used in this project is: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews
